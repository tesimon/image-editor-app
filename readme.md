## Description

This Web Image Editor App is a web-based image editor that allows users to apply various filters, rotate, and flip images. The application leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and modern features to provide a user-friendly and interactive experience.

## Features

- **Filter Options:** Users can adjust brightness, saturation, inversion, and grayscale using intuitive buttons.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

The application is structured using OOP principles, with the `ImageEditor` class serving as the main controller. This class encapsulates the functionality related to image editing, providing a clear and modular design.

## Best Practices

- **Event Delegation:** Utilizes event delegation to handle filter and rotate button clicks even when clicking on nested elements (texts/icons) inside buttons.

- **OOP Principles:** Organizes code into a class-based structure, promoting encapsulation, modularity, and readability.

- **Clear Naming:** Used clear and descriptive class and method names for improved code understanding.

- **Responsive Design:** The application features a responsive design for a seamless user experience across different devices.
